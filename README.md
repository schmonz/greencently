# Greencently

For teams whose commits fail on red tests, Greencently offers an optimization:
the pre-commit hook can know when you've run all tests green "recently enough".
Team chooses policy.

## Benefits (immediate)

- Lower-friction commits
- Time and energy saved

## Benefits (speculative)

Probably you'll lean into smaller, more frequent commits.
Maybe you'll also feel more able to invest in further test speedups.

## Usage

Nobody needs to learn anything.
The pre-commit hook still has your back when you forget to...

- Run any tests
- Run all tests
- Attend to red tests

With Greencently, the pre-commit hook also has your back when you _remember_.

All tests green, recently?
Commit quickly and stay in flow.
